emoji-table
===========

Annotated emoji table built from the online unicode charts.

The charts are sourced from [unicode.org](http://www.unicode.org/emoji/charts/emoji-list.html) and so should always be up-to-date.

[See the JSON catalog](dist/emoji.json)

Usage
-----
Install the emoji package:

    npm install emoji-table

You can then require it in your code:

~~~js
var emoji = require('emoji-table');

console.log(
    emoji.filter(function(e) {
        return e.keywords.indexOf('animal') !== -1;
    }).map(function(e) {
        return e.character;
    });
);
~~~

Each emoji in the list has this structure:

~~~json
{
    "name": "smiley",
    "number": 5,
    "codes": [
        "U+1F603"
    ],
    "codePoints": [
        128515
    ],
    "emoji": "ðŸ˜€",
    "group": "Smileys & People",
    "subGroup": "face-positive",
    "keywords": [
        "face",
        "mouth",
        "open",
        "smile"
    ],
    "tags": [
        "happy",
        "joy",
        "haha"
    ],
    "description": "smiling face with open mouth",
    "emoticons": [
        ":)",
        ":]",
        ":-)",
        ":-]",
        "=)",
        "=]",
        "=-)",
        "=-]"
    ]
}
