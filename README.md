emoji-table
===========

Annotated emoji table built from the online unicode charts.

The charts are sourced from [unicode.org](http://www.unicode.org/emoji/charts/full-emoji-list.html) and so should always be up-to-date.

[See the JSON catalog](dist/emoji.json)

Usage
-----
Install the emoji package:

	npm install emoji-table

You can then require it in your code:

~~~js
var emoji = require('emoji-table');

console.log(
    emoji.filter(function(e) {
        return e.keywords.indexOf('animal') !== -1;
    }).map(function(e) {
        return e.character;
    });
);
~~~

Each emoji in the list has this structure:

~~~json
{
    "name": "grinning face",
    "codePoints": [
        128512
    ],
    "character": "😀",
    "keywords": [
        "face",
        "grin"
    ],
    "date": 2012
}
~~~

You can also use the catalog directly in [`dist/emoji.json`](dist/emoji.json).
